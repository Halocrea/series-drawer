# Draw series for Halo Infinite tournaments
This tool is made to randomly draw games for your Halo Infinite competitive tournaments. You can then fine-tune it, and export the list as text for example or take a screenshot of the pretty table. It does its best to make it even, and it won't let the same map or mode show up in the same BoX series (unless it's like a Bo26 or something).

You can use it at [draw-series.halocrea.com](https://draw-series.halocrea.com/).

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

$ npm run dev

# build for production

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
